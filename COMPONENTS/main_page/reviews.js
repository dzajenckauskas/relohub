                They didn&apos;t damage anything and were amazing. Everything was
                perfect! Even glass items were all perfectly intact. Moved
                everything very fast and very efficiently. Amazing people! Would
                definitely recommend. Very happy with Relohub.

                Our experience was good. I cannot imagine that a firm could
                engage the customer as well as Relohub does - from start to
                finish. We were kept informed throughout. Well done to the firm
                and to Ernesto and his mate on this occasion..
