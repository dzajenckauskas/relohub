                    occurring on the ground floor with good access to your

                    apartment, you’ll need to bring goods to the ground floor.
                    This service includes transportation to your destination,
                    customs clearance, and delivery to the ground floor at the
                    other end.

                <h3>How do you calculate the cost of my shipment?</h3>

                <p>
                    The cost of your shipment will be determined using a number
                    of variables. These include the shipment’s origin and
                    destination; the nature of the service you choose (sea
                    freight / air freight / courier / door-to-door / etc) and
                    the weight and / or volume of the items being transported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need both the actual weight and the volumetric weight of
                    an item to determine the costs associated with transporting
                    it to your destination. The initial price you receive at the
                    time of booking (online or over the phone) is an estimate
                    based solely on the measurements and weights that you
                    provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we’ve collected everything, the shipment will arrive at
                    one of our distribution hubs to be weighed and measured
                    (unless it is traveling direct – see below section: When do
                    I pay?). Those weights and measurements are used to
                    calculate your final invoice, which will be issued to you
                    via the Customer Portal and by email (usually within 48
                    hours of collection). The more accurate you are when
                    providing the initial dimensions and weights of your items,
                    the more likely it is that your final invoice will match
                    your original quotation (see section below: How do I measure
                    and weigh my items?).

                    <strong>Measuring your items:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s best to use a tape measure to record the dimensions of
                    any items as this is the most accurate method. If you do not
                    have a tape measure, you can use a ruler, but this won’t be
                    as accurate and could result in the price needing to be
                    adjusted to account for inaccuracies in the original
                    estimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You need to measure the longest length on each side and
                    include any handles, wheels or bulges as these need to be
                    accounted for when calculating the volume of the item.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Weighing your items:</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not have scales suitable for obtaining the weight
                    of your item(s), you can use household bathroom scales.
                    First weigh yourself while you’re holding an item and make a
                    note of the figure (weight A). Then weigh yourself without
                    the item (weight B). Deducting weight B from weight A will
                    provide you with the weight of your item. It’s worth
                    rounding the figure up to allow for any inaccuracies.

                <p>
                    When you make a booking with Relohub, we will take an
                    initial deposit (usually £100 / €100 / $150 depending on
                    your country of origin). This is to secure the booking,
                    cover any packing materials and hold the requested
                    collection and shipping dates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your dedicated Client Services Executive will contact you 72
                    hours prior to your collection, which you’ll have confirmed
                    at the time of booking. At this time, they will take 80% of
                    the outstanding balance. Once your belongings have been
                    collected and returned to our distribution centre, we will
                    calculate your final invoice. The outstanding balance should
                    then be paid within 48 hours of receipt of this final
                    invoice so that items can be dispatched in a timely manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> For smaller consignments, we
                    may arrange for our carrier to collect and send your item(s)
                    direct to your destination without going via the
                    distribution centre. In this case, we will issue a final
                    invoice 72 hours before collection and the full amount must
                    be settled prior to collection. If this applies to you,
                    you’ll be advised by your Client Services Executive
                    accordingly.

                    Full instructions on how to pay will be outlined on your
                    final invoice. Final invoices will usually be available
                    within 48 hours of collection, unless your move is going
                    direct (see When do I pay? section), in which case your
                    invoice will be available 72 hours before your scheduled
                    collection slot. Invoices will be emailed to you.

                <p>
                    No. But it is important to be aware that certain shipments
                    may incur additional fees, taxes and tariffs that cannot be
                    included on the final invoice and must be paid separately.

                    Any customs and quarantine inspection fees, import taxes and
                    fumigation charges are excluded from our quotations. These
                    fees do not apply to all shipments and differ from country
                    to country. Often determined based on the nature of the
                    shipment itself, they are not possible to calculate in
                    advance or pre-pay so will not appear on your Relohub

                    cover options, if you don’t wish to take out any form of
                    cover, you’ll need to digitally sign a declaration to
                    confirm you’ve made the decision not to take out insurance.
                    This declaration must be completed before your goods can be

                    dedicated ‘account manager’ and they will be responsible for
                    validating your booking to ensure we have fully understood
                    your needs and requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They will also discuss and outline all the documents that
                    are required to fulfil your delivery. Of course, at this
                    point you’ll be able to ask any questions you may have
                    regarding the transportation of your belongings. You will
                    also receive follow up emails with instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While general updates and reminders will be sent by email,
                    your dedicated Client Services Executive will be on hand to
                    assist you throughout the whole process, to ensure your
                    delivery is stress free from start to finish.

                <h3>Do you provide boxes?</h3>

                <p>
                    Yes. Relohub has developed high-quality cardboard export
                    boxes. The boxes are double-walled and reinforced to
                    withstand the rigours of international travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Protecting our environment is very important to Relohub,
                    that’s why our boxes are 100% recyclable (made from recycled
                    materials), and they are designed to be re-used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our boxes can be included as part of your order, in which
                    case they will be delivered to you on a selected date prior
                    to your collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are unable to provide boxes and materials in some
                    locations. If we are unable to provide ‘boxes’ in your
                    location, you will need to source your own boxes locally.

                <h3>What types of boxes does Relohub provide?</h3>

                <p>Relohub boxes come in two different sizes.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Large Box:</strong> 50 x 50 x 50cm - Ideal for
                    larger, lightweight items such as clothing, linens, bedding,
                    home, and kitchenware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Standard Box:</strong> 40 x 40 x 40cm - Better for
                    smaller, heavier items like books. As a general rule, heavy
                    items should be packed into smaller, more compact boxes to
                    keep the overall weight of the box down. Heavy items can
                    also cause damage to larger boxes when they move around
                    inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> As per our Terms & Conditions,
                    Relohub accepts no liability for fragile items unless your
                    shipment has been professionally packed by our team of
                    experts.

                <h3>Can I use my own Boxes?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can use your own boxes, but you need to be extremely
                    careful. It’s vital to ensure they are not damaged and that
                    they are reinforced and of high quality. Your boxes need to
                    be very strong to withstand the rigours of international
                    shipping, and boxes purchased online or from a self-storage
                    facility may not be suitable for an overseas move. You need
                    double-walled cardboard export boxes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using your own boxes, you may incur a higher excess
                    level on your insurance cover (see ‘Is there an excess to
                    pay?), and further restrictions may apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> If we receive a consignment to
                    one of our facilities where we deem the boxes to be of low
                    quality, we may make the decision to re-pack the items into
                    our boxes. This will incur additional expenses and delay the
                    shipment, so we implore all customers to carefully consider
                    the packing materials they use, and if in any doubt, obtain
                    new boxes here.

            <div>
                <h3>Can I use other types of packaging?</h3>
                <p>
                    We’d always advise using reinforced Relohub boxes. If you
                    are thinking of using suitcases as well as or instead of
                    boxes, we would recommend hard cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> that we cannot take
                    responsibility for damage to any suitcase you use to
                    transport your goods.

                <h3>
                    Are there any types of packaging that are NOT acceptable?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. There are a number of containers / boxes / bags that
                    are not acceptable or suitable for overseas transportation:
                </p>

                <h3>Used boxes</h3>

                <p>
                    While some boxes are designed to be re-used, you must be
                    very careful when packing your items into used boxes for
                    overseas shipping. Firstly, the slightest bit of wear and
                    tear will severely compromise the contents, so do not use
                    any box that has any structural or cosmetic damage.
                    Secondly, if the boxes were not designed for overseas
                    transport (e.g. boxes collected from the supermarket) they
                    should not be used. They will not have the structural
                    reinforcement to withstand the rigours of international
                    travel. Also, if the boxes were ever used to transport food,
                    you may incur customs and quarantine delays / fines.
                    Finally, if the boxes were ever used to ship dangerous /
                    flammable / toxic goods, they may display warning icons and
                    labels that will be flagged at customs, leading to extra
                    inspection and added delays / fines.

            <div>
                <h3>Plastic storage boxes / crates</h3>
                <p>
                    Plastic storage boxes are, as the name suggests, designed
                    for storage only. They are for organising items within the
                    home. They are not designed for transporting items. The
                    plastic is extremely brittle and the various rigours of the
                    shipping process will cause these boxes to break. This means
                    you risk losing items from the box or losing the box itself.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Storage / archive boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    These boxes are not designed for shipping. They are usually
                    made from thin, single-walled cardboard. They often have
                    lids that are not as easy to secure and they often include
                    holes on the sides, which act as handles for ease of lifting
                    and stacking. However, these compromise the structural
                    integrity of the box. Storage and archive boxes will not
                    protect your items and are more likely to rip or be crushed
                    in transit.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Laundry bags / IKEA bags</h3>
                <p>
                    These large, plastic zip-up bags may seem suitable but
                    (aside from being waterproof) they offer no protection to
                    your items. They will rip and be crushed in transit. No bag
                    is suitable for an overseas move so everything must be
                    stored in a robust box or case.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Bin liners</h3>
                <p>
                    This really should go without saying, but unfortunately bin
                    liners are on the list because we have received them in the
                    past. They offer zero protection to their contents and will
                    rip within a few hours of collection. It’s very unlikely
                    that a bin liner would make it to the other side, and
                    nothing you put inside would be safe.

                <h3>What if I don’t have any boxes or packing material?</h3>
                <p>
                    Don’t worry, you can order boxes online, or by speaking to
                    your Client Services Executive (or one of our Sales Team)
                    who will be delighted to assist you. There are, however, a
                    number of countries we are currently unable to service due
                    to restrictions, there are also some destinations where you
                    may be charged duties and taxes.

                <h3>How do I label my boxes?</h3>
                <p>
                    Labelling your items clearly and securely is very important.
                    Items that are not properly labelled will not be collected
                    and Relohub, and our delivery partners, are not responsible
                    for any shipment that is delayed or misplaced as a result of
                    labels becoming detached or damaged during shipping.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will need to attach TWO labels to EACH box. They should
                    be securely adhered to the most prominent sides of the box
                    and NOT to the top, as the labels need to be visible when
                    boxes are stacked.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The best way to fix labels to a box is to use adhesive label
                    sleeves. These can usually be obtained from post offices and
                    stationary shops. Alternatively, we recommend using a clear
                    plastic wallet to protect the label from water / dirt / wear
                    and tear. You could also use strips of clear tape to protect
                    the label, but you would still need to secure the outer
                    edges of the label with packing tape to ensure it is secure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You must always make sure you tape around all four edges of
                    each label with packing tape. To ensure each label is extra
                    secure, you can even wrap a few of these strips of tape all
                    the way around the box so it doubles back on itself and
                    overlaps for extra security. We also recommend including an
                    additional address label on the inside of the box somewhere
                    that it can be easily found / seen just in case something
                    happens to the outer labels.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IMPORTANT: Any applicable customs forms and packing lists
                    must be attached separately from the tracking labels (but in
                    the same secure manner) to remain visible to the relevant
                    customs authority.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How do I attach labels to a suitcase?</h3>
                <p>
                    Remove all previous labels from any item you wish to send.
                    If you leave old labels on any items, these may cause
                    confusion and could result in the item being delayed,
                    missorted or returned to the collection address.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please do not attach your labels with tape alone, as your
                    labels are likely to fall off and could result in your item
                    being delayed. Adhesive label sleeves can usually be
                    obtained from post offices and stationary shops.
                    Alternatively, if you do not have access to these, you can
                    use a clear plastic wallet to protect your label, making
                    sure you tape around all four edges, taping all the way
                    around the item if possible so that the tape overlaps for
                    extra security.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>When will I receive my labels?</h3>
                <p>
                    Labels should be available at least five days prior to
                    collection. If your booking is for a collection within the
                    next five working days, your labels should be available soon
                    after completing your order.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In some cases, international couriers may issue labels
                    slightly later, but you should still have them within two
                    days of your collection. If your order was placed recently,
                    please be patient and we will make your labels available as
                    soon as possible.
                </p>

                <p>Labels will be sent to your email.</p>

                <p>
                    If your collection is occurring in the next two days and you
                    have not yet received your labels, please contact your
                    Client Services Executive.

            <div>
                <h3>Do I need to print my labels?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. We will issue your labels via email for you to print.
                    It is important that you have access to a printer as you
                    will be responsible for printing off labels for EACH ITEM
                    within your shipment.
                </p>

                <h4>What if I cannot print my labels?</h4>
                <p>
                    Office supply companies usually provide printing services if
                    you do not have a printer at home. We also recommend
                    including an additional address label on the inside of the
                    shipment somewhere that it can be easily found / seen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please ensure these labels are
                    securely attached with tape all the way around
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Can I lock my items?</h3>
                <p>
                    No, your items must not be locked unless you are using a
                    combination lock. This is because most shipments will
                    undergo security / customs checks after collection, and
                    customs and / or the courier may need to verify the contents
                    of your items. If they are unable to gain access to an item,
                    they may refuse the shipment. In this case, the items will
                    be delayed or returned to you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Don’t worry; however, your items are completely safe as they
                    are sent within a closed logistic network.

                <h3>What can I pack?</h3>
                <p>
                    You should only pack personal effects, clothes, shoes,
                    linen, books, & toys.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please carefully familiarise
                    yourself with the Fragile, Prohibited & Restricted Items
                    Lists before packing. These are provided on the Customer
                    Portal and will require your digital signature to confirm
                    you’ve read and understood everything. (See also the section
                    below Is there anything I can’t send?). Fragile and / or
                    deeply sentimental items should also not be packed and are
                    not covered against breakages.

                <h3>Is there anything I can’t send?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. There are a number of items that are prohibited and
                    restricted. Certain items cannot be imported as personal
                    effects into certain countries or may require an import
                    licence. Such items may be subject to inspection and / or
                    treatment. Some items are only restricted / prohibited if
                    traveling by airfreight, while other items are prohibited
                    from all services. We recommend not packing any of these
                    items under any circumstances, as their inclusion in your
                    shipment (even if packed in error) could result in severe
                    delays at customs and additional fees.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Restricted and Prohibited items include Alcohol or Tobacco;
                    Agricultural, Diary, or meat products; Dried Flowers, Herbs,

                    Bamboo, Basket ware, Mats, or Wood Packaging; Many firearms,
                    knives (including Sharpe kitchen knives), Bayonets, switch
                    blades or swords; Pornographic Material, Seditious, and
                    treasonable material; Bone or shell articles; Electrical
                    items, particularly those that have rechargeable lithium
                    batteries (such as laptops, tablets, drones and mobile
                    phones).

                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You will be responsible for
                    additional costs if examination, treatment or disposal is
                    ordered at customs. Where charges are incurred for the
                    removal of non-permitted or restricted goods by an airline,
                    handling agent, consolidator etc, these charges will be
                    passed on to you together with a £250 / $350 or €300
                    administration fee, and your belongings will be delayed
                    until such charges are paid.

                <h3>What about fragile items?</h3>
                <p>
                    We strongly recommend against sending fragile items,
                    particularly if they are of sentimental value. International
                    shipping is not a delicate process, so there are no
                    guarantees that fragile items will be safe in transit. For
                    this reason, unless your items have been professionally
                    packed by Relohub, fragile items will not be covered
                    against any breakages caused in transit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fragile goods include: Bulbs; Cathode ray tubes packed in
                    cases or cartons or waterproof crates; Chinaware; Crystal
                    ware; Domestic glass; Earthenware; Enamelware; Furniture
                    with glass; Ornaments & Sculptures; Glassware; Neon tubes;
                    Pottery; Sanitary ware; TV’s & Monitors and Computers &
                    Laptops

                <h3>Do I need to make an inventory of my belongings?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes. This is very VERY important! Customs authorities need
                    to know exactly what is contained within any shipment
                    entering into the country. The more detailed the inventory,
                    the better as you’ll minimize delays and you’re more likely
                    to avoid extra inspections (though this can never be
                    guaranteed, as inspections are at the sole discretion of the
                    customs authority).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will email you an inventory form together with a booking
                    confirmation, please fill it in and return at least 5 days
                    before collection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Do I complete my inventory?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also email you a checklist of all the steps that
                    need to be completed and it contains all the documents
                    you’ll need to fill out. This includes the inventory, which
                    needs to be filled out, saved, and signed before we can
                    collect your goods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a general rule, you need to fill out as many details as
                    you can. You mustn’t simply write ‘clothing’. You’ll need to
                    itemize the clothing that’s going into the boxes and
                    attribute a value to each item.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It can be a time-consuming process, but it will save you
                    delays at customs. You can write it all down in a notepad
                    and transfer it across on our paperwork at the later stages.

                <h3>Do I have to pay custom duties and taxes?</h3>
                <p>
                    This entirely depends on the origin and destination of your
                    shipment, as well as the nature and value of the items
                    you’re sending. This means that there is unfortunately no
                    simple answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For this reason, customs duties and taxes are excluded from
                    our pricing (as mentioned in the above sections{" "}
                    <em>What services can I choose from?</em> and{" "}
                    <em>Are there any Hidden Costs?</em>).
                </p>

                <p>
                    It’s simply impossible to include these types of charges as
                    they are calculated by customs authorities at the point of
                    inspection. Customs duties and taxes should only apply to
                    items that are declared to be unused or that have been owned
                    for less than 12 months. However, even this is subject to
                    local regulations and any inspection or storage fees,
                    fumigation charges or disposal costs (for prohibited items)
                    can be added separately.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Duties and taxes can also apply
                    if the owner / recipient of the shipment is not in the
                    country of destination when the goods arrive. Storage
                    charges begin to accrue if items are not cleared through
                    customs swiftly, which is important to note if you’ve booked
                    a Door-to-Port / Airport service.
                </p>

                <p>

                    together a cancellation policy that’s designed to be as fair

                <p>
                    During this extraordinary and on-going situation with
                    Coronavirus (Covid-19), we are working to safeguard the
                    health of our customers and our teams as much as is
                    possible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have instructed our drivers and partners to stay at least
                    two paces away from you during the process of delivery and
                    collection. All delivery and collection activities must be
                    completed outside at kerbside, so please do not ask drivers
                    to enter your premises under any circumstances. This is a
                    change from our normal procedure – now our drivers should
                    remain outside and must not proceed beyond the front door.
                    We regret any inconvenience this may cause.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you need assistance with moving your belongings from
                    indoors to the kerbside, please make the necessary
                    arrangements with a friend / family member (taking into
                    account any current social distancing guidelines and
                    relevant rules regarding visits to your home).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Signatures are no longer required for collection or
                    delivery. Instead, our driver will write either your full
                    name or the full name of the person who is present in the
                    signature box.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Photos will now be our proof of delivery/collection, so
                    drivers will photograph the items upon delivery (outside
                    your door). However, in respect of your privacy, our drivers
                    are instructed not to photograph you, or any member of your
                    family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We recommend you take similar photos for your own records.
