                            If payments are up to date, we will not withdraw
                            storage of your goods without giving you three
                            months advance notice in writing.

                            If you wish to terminate your storage contract, you
                            must give us at least 10 working days’ notice
                            (working days are defined in Clause 7 above). If we
                            can release the goods earlier, we will do so,
                            provided that your account is paid up to date,
                            although storage will be charged up to the end of
                            the specified minimum 10 days’ notice period.
